\label{cha:}


We believe as and as robots become more autonomous, the robot will be able to record more and more obserations. This will help the approaches discussed in the thesis to be more accurate and make better predictions.
 create a behavioural map of the house and its occupants, including room function and occupancy modelling, household activities and routines.

Uncover habits and predict human behaviour 


enhance the quality of life by  ... 

All models are developed with the user at the center. 

All the models were developed using probabilistic programming languages 


We have demonstrated the  powerful aspects of model-based machine learning is the ability to extend the model to take account of more complex situations. 
Model was first developed for learning from single location,  which was extended to model which could learn multiple locations.
