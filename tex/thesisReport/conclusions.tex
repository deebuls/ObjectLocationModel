Summary 

In the thesis we were able to formulate the problem of knowledge generation from information using Bayesian models. Different Bayesian models were developed like Hierarchical Beta Bernoulli, Dirichlet Categorical, Hierarchical Dirichlet Categorical and Hierarchical Dirichlet Categorical Bernoulli.

We believe as and as robots become more autonomous, the robot will be able to record more and more obserations. This will help the approaches discussed in the thesis to be more accurate and make better predictions.

All models are developed with the user at the center. 

All the models were developed using probabilistic programming languages 


We have demonstrated the  powerful aspects of model-based machine learning is the ability to extend the model to take account of more complex situations. 
Model was first developed for learning from single location,  which was extended to model which could learn multiple locations. 
\section{Future Work}

\subsection{Detecting Changes}
One of the basic assumption, on which the thesis is based on that humans have preferences and these can be learned. However, its observed that humans change their preferences. Humans are highly adaptive beings and change their behaviour and preferences frequently. Robots should also have capabilities to detect these changes. One of the future extension would be for doing Bayesian change point detection.

\subsection{Merging Object State Estimation and Object Location Prediction}
Object state estimation is an active field of research\cite{schulz2001probabilistic} where the objects are recognized by a detector and the future states are estimated. State estimator are very useful in predicting short time future states/locations. On the contrary object location predictors are good for long term prediction. A good future work would be to merge both state estimation and location prediction for robots to perform search better.
