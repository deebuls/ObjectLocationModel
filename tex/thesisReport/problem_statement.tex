\label{sec:Problem formulation}

The problem can be formulated as getting an accurate probability density of possible locations given the previous observed locations. Given the corresponding observations of $D_{o_i}$, the probability distribution over the locations of $o_i$ at time $T$ is governed by the following formula 

    \begin{equation} \label{eq:1}
	    P(l_i | t_i, D_{o_i})
    \end{equation}

   Various temporal information related to periodic patterns can be implied by $T$, to indicate the location distribution. Such as specific hours of the day (11:00 pm), a day of the week(Friday), or a month of the year(February). We use the \textbf{temporal state} to represent such information and introduce $r(t)$ to denote temporal state extracted from time $T$,.  Dependency on the type of the temporal state $r(t)$ can be a different function. For example,if $r(t)$ denotes temporal state in terms of hours of the day then $r(t) \in {0,1 ... , 23}$, if $r(t)$ denotes temporal state in terms of day of the week, then $r(t) \in {0,1, .. 6}$ . Without loss of generality, we use $r(t)$ to denote a type of temporal state in the following description, Equation \ref{eq:1} is reformulated as 
    
    \begin{equation}
	    P( l_i | r(t), D_{o_i})
    \end{equation}
    
    Applying Bayes Rule
    
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:3}
	P( l_i | r(t), D_{o_i}) \propto P(r(t) | l_i, D_{o_i})  P(l_i | D_{o_i})
    \end{equation}
    Where:
    \begin{itemize}[label=]
    \item $P(r(t) | l_i, D_{o_i})$ : Temporal context 
    \item $P(l_i | D_{o_i})$ : Spatial context
    \end{itemize}
    
     The spatial context $P(l_i | D_{o_i})$ indicates the location distribution of object or person $o_i$ given the previous observed location $D_{o_i}$ . The temporal context $P(r(t) | l_i, D_{o_i})$ represents the temporal state distribution of object $o_i$, being observed at location $l_i$ with corresponding $D_{o_i}$
