    "at the office)or while attending regular football practice on a Saturday afternoon), to\n",
    "sudden spikes in unpredictability (e.g., travelling to another city on a weekend break, or\n",
    "while on sick leave). Consequently, there are contexts in which historical patterns have\n",

    "example, a robot assistant that knows where cups are located, does not have to search for them.\n",
    "Similarly, a robot can only clean up a part of the world if it understands what are the objects\n",
    "that can be picked up but also the location where they normally belong. In general, robots\n",
    "must know information about the functions of objects such as the handles of doors, in order to\n",
    "manipulate them competently. To function efficiently, it is imperative that these environment\n",
    "models are acquired autonomously and therefore support the deployment of mobile robots in\n",
    "new environments, without requiring too many software updates or manual user input, because\n",
    "they are able to adapt themselves to the changes in the environment."
