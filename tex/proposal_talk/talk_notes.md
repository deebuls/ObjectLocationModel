# Introduction
Hi I am Deebul Nair. I am currently doing my masters in Autonomous system in
Hochschule Bonn-Rhine-Sieg. Welcome to my proposal talk of my thesis. I am
doing my thesis with Professor Ploeger and Professor Leikermier and Tim.

# Brain Teasers
Before I start into the details lets look into ourselves this will help me in
guiding you through the vision of the thesis. I want you all to imagine that
you are in your home. Ok so now lets answer some questions in here.
- Where is the milk?
- Where is the plate?
- Where is the glass?

I hope you have imagined the places these objects are present. My question to
you would were you able to figure their locations because you had seen it last
time there or is it a belief? This belief we develop from our expereinces. In
this situation of you being in your home there is bit bias as you were the one
who organized the home so you are aware of the locations. But the same applies
if you had been in your firends home.
The conclusion being for such trivial tasks also Humans learn from expereince.
# Expereince 
The basic idea of my thesis also lies in this of "Can robots learn from
experience?" . This is not a first time its being asked. The whole of Machine
Learning and the some of the AI community is being trying to answer this
question. I am just extending this to the robots prespective.
Two terms I have described with human as example . "Belief" and "Expereince".

# Predicting object locations

So what is that I want the robot to learn from its expereinces?
As I explained in the example . The theme of my thesis is to predict the
locations of the objects in a dynamic environment.

# Example

Lets assume that we put a domestic robot to a new home. I has the semantic maps
and is ableto navigate and complete its daily tasks.
While doing its daily tasks it collects data and manipulates objects.
while doing this its recording the object locations in its memory.
blah blah blah

# Assumptions
No external sensors
semantic map

# State of the Art
