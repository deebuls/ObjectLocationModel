## Some Questions

Suppose you have been moved to a new home and you dont know anything
about the home. Now let me ask some questions. Please analyze how the brain
works.

. . .

- Where will you find a milk bottle

. . .

- Where will you find a plate

. . .

- Where will you find a cup


# Learning from experience


## Predicting Object Location

- The theme of the thesis is to predict the location of objects in a dynamic
environment
- Subject to constraints:
    - Data used to locate will be collected by a mobile robot
    - The robot has semantic information of the environment
    - Minimum external information to be used

## Example

- insert images

## What have other people done:

- Mind map and explain

## Enabling Factors :

- Long term Autonomous robots are becoming a reality now.
    - Problems of **long term navigation** are getting solved
    - This enables is having robots which will run forever in highly dynamic
      environments
- Database technologies in Robots
    - This enables the robot to keep track of all information it has generated

## Why this is challenging 

- Sparsity of the data

## How do we predict?

- Count the object locations. The location with highest count becomes the most
  probable location.
- TODO : Bar Plot
- Hypothesis 1 :
    - Adding time dimension to the data improves the prediction than the
      prediction made without.

# Approach

# Model Based Machine Learning

## Classical Machine Learning
    - TODO blackbox approach
    - Image with all learning algorithms

## Model Based Machine Learning
    - TODO Image
. . .
- Hypothesis 2:
    MBML will provide better predictions than classical machine learning 
    algorithms in sparse dataset
