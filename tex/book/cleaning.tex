\chapter{Cleaning robot scenario}

If you grew up watching the Jetsons, the idea of having a robot helper that cleans and cooks for your family has always been a fantasy. People want to have a robot do the housework and the good news is that great minds are working on it.

Elon Musk announced back in June that his OpenAI robotic institute was working on developing software that would enable off-the-shelf robots to do household chores and various other engineers are working on robots that could accomplish cleaning and organizing tasks.

 In order for a robot to clean an entire house, it would have to be able to fully understand its environment and make decisions based on the state of each room -- something that is beyond the current abilities of artificial intelligence.
