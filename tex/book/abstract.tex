Our aim is to predict locations of objects in
a particular home environment, where we have a prior map of the
environment and the knowledge of the previous locations of the objects . The prediction of the location of the object helps in
reducing the search time for objects in known environments.
 In this thesis, we propose to develop a
probabilistic model to capture the dynamics of observed objects in any
particular environment, called as the \textbf{object location model}.
The object location model will make use of both spatial and temporal information
recorded by the robot to make predictions.
Even though all homes show much similarity in
their spatial organization, the usage of the space and the objects in it is
entirely based on the user's preferences. Most of the previous work on object location prediction is based upon predicting the object's location in a generic home while the proposed model will make predictions for a specific home. The model will
explicitly reason about the user's preferences for the location of the objects.
