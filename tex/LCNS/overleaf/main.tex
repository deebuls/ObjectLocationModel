\begin{abstract}
Our aim is to predict locations of objects in a particular home environment, where we
have a prior map of the environment and the knowledge of the previous locations of the
objects . The prediction of the location of the object helps in reducing the search time for
objects in known environments. In this paper, we propose to develop a probabilistic model
to capture the dynamics of observed objects in any particular environment, called as the
object location model. The object location model will make use of both spatial and
temporal information recorded by the robot to make predictions. Even though all homes
show much similarity in their spatial organization, the usage of the space and the objects
in it is entirely based on the user’s preferences. Most of the previous work on object
location prediction is based upon predicting the object’s location in a generic home while
the proposed model will make predictions for a specific home. The model will explicitly
reason about the user’s preferences for the location of the objects.

\section{Introduction}
As robots move from more structured environments of laboratories to unstructured environments like homes and offices, multiple challenges arises. One of the challenge is
estimating the location of objects in less structured and more uncertain environments.
This challenge led to probabilistic mapping of objects location in the environment, which
enables estimating objects location based on last seen information. Some authors have
made effort to obtain information about the world dynamics and proposed representations
that model the object dynamics explicitly. This representation lead to potential improvement in the search for objects in highly dynamic environment. However, as robots achieve
long term autonomy, a new challenge appeared that the object locations in natural environment are subject to change in a particular pattern. Although the probabilistic state
estimation of objects can deal with changes in the location of objects, their approach is
rooted in making conclusions based on the last seen location. This approach is good for
estimating the location of object in a world model. But it does not consider the information available based on the movement of the object for predicting the object location.
This information of the current state if recorded then analysis can be run on the object
location to understand the mobility pattern in the object location over time. Modeling
this object mobility pattern will help in predicting the object location in the environment.
The prediction of location will further enhance the search of objects.
In classical object search, the search is on a generic home which causes the learning
of the object location to be finite. Whereas the object search problem in real life is a
continuous learning process which never stops. Unlike the classical object search, the pro-
posed spatio-temporal object location learning is a daily task which the robot has to carry
out along with its daily routine. A typical spatio-temporal object location learning will
consist of repeated observations of different objects in the environment spread throughout
the robot’s operational time. Based on the observations the object model will be generated
and updated. The learned model will then be used to predict the searched object location
thus reducing the search time.
The generic home scenario, in classical object search doesn’t take into account the
differences in object locations from home to home. Based on practical experience we know
that the even though homes have same base structure in space but the usage of the space
is based on the user preferences. Each home is different from other home because of the
humans which reside in them use it according to their likes. The proposed model will try to learn these user preferences in each home. So rather than learning object locations in
a generalized home the proposed model shall learn object locations in a specific home.

Consider a domestic robot which has been placed in a home environment with a
known map and semantic information of the different locations in the home. The domestic
robot while doing its daily activities makes a record of the objects seen in the environment
with their location and time. Now the robot has been asked to bring the coffee mug of the
user. The robot has to make a decision which part of the home it has to go to look for the
coffee mug. The robot can make this decision based on the previous observations of the
location of the coffee mug. The robot using the previous observations and the time of those
observations makes a prediction about where the coffee mug can be found at the current
time. Based on previous observation it can be inferred that the coffee mug is usually found
in any of the following three location dishwasher/platform/cupboard. Assuming that the
time now is morning, from previous observations it can be found that the coffee mug was
always found in the dishwasher. The above example illustrate the main aspects of object
location prediction we wish to capture in our work.
The model needs to capture two main elements; first that objects in a human environment are not placed randomly but usually have a certain set of places where they are
placed. These places of object placement differ from home to home. These object locations entirely depends on the users preferences. Second, that human behavior is related
to time i.e. Humans have daily routines and the object locations are influenced by these
routines. Thus human behavior not only has a spatial behavior but also has a temporal
behavior. The model will reason on both user preference of the object location and the
object-time relation.
