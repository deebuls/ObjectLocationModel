Our aim is to predict the location of objects, where we have a prior map of the
environment and the knowledge of previous seen locations of the same object in
a particular home environment. Prediction of the location of object helps in
reducing the search time of objects in known environments.
 In our thesis, we propose to develop a
probabilistic model to capture the dynamics of observed objects in any
particular environment, called as the \textbf{object location model}.
The object location model will make use of both spatial and temporal information
recorded by the robot to make the predictions.
Even though all homes show major similarity in
their spatial organization, the usage of the space and the objects in it is
entirely based on the users preferences. Previous work on object location prediction are based upon predicting the object location in a generic home while the proposed model will make predictions for a specific home. The model will
explicitly reason about the user preferences in the location of the objects.
