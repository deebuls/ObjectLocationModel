SUMMARY: 
- The paper is titled to be about a Automated approach to evaluating Motion Planners.
But most of the paper talks about the usage of the automated approach. It compares
different motion planner and their performances as recorded by the automated approach.

ORIGINALITY: 
- The approach to evaluation ic completely new. The evaluation strategy is automated.
- The paper points out the differences from related research as the current work 
is completely automated. The comparison of motion planning algorithms is studied
in depth. Automated motion planning evaluation research paradigm is discussed in 
detail.

SIGNIFICANCE 
- The work is important for providing quantitative analysis of the motion planning
approaches
- It clearly advances the state of the art based on the evaluation strategy.
- Yes, the paper stimulate discussion of important issues or alternative poins of view.

TECHNICAL QUALITY 
- The paper is rechnically sound.
- The argument of automated evaluation strategy for planning methods is quite revelaing.
- The contributions of the work is not clearly mentioned.
- The methods compares all the available motion planning techniques.
- The paper evaluated all the methods

QUALITY OF PRESENTATION 
- The writting can be improved specially more details of the automated planning 
has to be added
- The paper motivates the research on the field on automated testing.
- The results are well documented

SUMMARY OF REVIEW:

The paper is titled as the Automated testing but it gives very scant on the 
bechmarking tools and automation. The comparison of the different motion planning
algorithms is through evaluation of all the motion planning algorithms available.
