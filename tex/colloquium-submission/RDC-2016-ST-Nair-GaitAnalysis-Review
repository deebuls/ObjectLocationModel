SUMMARY: 
- The paper is about doing gait analysis in outddor environments with moving 
cameras. 

ORIGINALITY: 
- The paper is the review of all the current approaches available in the field
of outdoor gait analysis.
- The paper compares the different aproaches based on the 8 parameters. It doesnt
addresses any new method . 

SIGNIFICANCE 
- Work is significant for any other student working on the gait analysis.
- It doesnt advance the state of the art but surely states the state of the art.
- The paper clearly maintains all the advanatages and disadvantages of the 
state of the art methods.

TECHNICAL QUALITY 
- The paper is technically sound.
- Are the paper's arguments compelling? 
- No the paper doesnt carefully evaluate the strengths and limitations of its contributions? 
- The paper doesnt create new form of evidence against but states from the previous papers.
- The paper adds information of the state of gait analysis
- There is a careful evaluation in the paper.
- The paper lacks in its comparison the evaluation on real dataset.

QUALITY OF PRESENTATION 
- Yes, the paper clearly written.
- The paper motivate the research.
- The results are clearly evaluated.

===============================================
SUMMARY OF REVIEW:

The paper mentions of the 8 parameters on which the methods were compared.
The paper stops at mentioning the different approaches and stating what was stated 
in the other paper. The author should have looked into how good the mention 
parameters of gait analysis worked. Which worked better and which didnt work.
Some paper claimed to work in outdoor, but to what level is not known.
No added information on the comparison on each feature mentioned.
